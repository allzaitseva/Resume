        <p>Hi, I’m Olena Zaitseva, a front-end developer.</p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          For a long time, I worked as a digital artist, drawing on my tablet
          and creating illustrations.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          But deep down, I was fascinated by how technology works, how a blank
          page in a browser can become something alive and interactive.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          That’s how I found front-end development. It lets me combine both
          sides of myself creativity and logic and turn ideas into living,
          functional designs on the web.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-5">
          I genuinely enjoy every step of the process: from a first idea to a
          finished website that feels clean, thoughtful, and alive.
        </p>
